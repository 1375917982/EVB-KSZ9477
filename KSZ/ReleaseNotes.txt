4. Release History
------------------

V1.1.2 : 07/19/2017
	1. Linux PTP utilities are updated to better support the PTP stack.
	2. An SD card can be used to boot and run the system.

V1.1.1 : 05/03/2017
	1. Linux PTP is updated to version 1.8.  The pmc utility can use
	   Management messages to pass information from the PTP stack.  There
	   is an explicit command to change the neighborPropDelayThresh and
	   asCapable settings on the fly.
	2. MSTP support is added to KSZ9897.  It is still not enabled by
	   default and requires manual kernel configuration to enable it.  The
	   old RSTP code is still being used.

V1.1.0 : 02/08/2017
	1. Newer revision of UNG8071 board is used.  As such the GPIO
	   interrupt is changed from 10 to 28.
	2. DLR daemon is added to communicate with DLR management program so
	   that a DLR demo can be run.
	3. The Atmel Cadence MAC driver can use IBA-only mode for demo
	   purpose.
	4. The MAC and switch drivers can be run as modules and unloaded.
	5. UNG8087 board is supported.  However, it requires a different
	   Device Tree configuration as the RGMII setting is different.

V1.0 : 12/23/2016 
	1. Ethernet Switch Driver with VLAN, ACL, 802.1x, RSTP support.
	2. LinuxPTP, OpenAVB support -  Beta version.
